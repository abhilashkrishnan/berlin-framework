# Berlin Framework
Dependency Injection, IoC and MVC Framework for the web. 

#Why another framework?

Berlin Framework aims to be a `superheroic and innovative polygot web framework` with support for `Java, Scala, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby and Groovy`. What it means is that you will be able to write complete web applications in any or all of those programming languages using Berlin Framework. 

Berlin Framework will provide you `hassle-free` interoperability between code written in multiple programming languages. For example you will be able to write a web module in PHP or Python or Ruby and a database module in Java or Scala. You will be seamlessly able to call data access operations of the Java or Scala database module from the web module written in PHP or Python or Ruby all deployed in the same container. Invocation of methods across disparate languages works without the use of RPC or Web Services. It will work "as a" `native method call` (while deployed in the same container) without the use of any cumbersome or additional configuration and hence it will be much faster compared to RPC or Web Services which involves the overhead of `marshalling and unmarshalling` of objects. RPC and Web Services components are also prone to issues with `Network Congestion and Latency`. Hence we try to avoid it all costs at the same time providing deployment of polygot modules in the same container and eventually invoke the operations "as a" `native method call`. And that's `secret sauce` of Berlin Framework! 

Your development pipeline will be able to `mix-and-match` and be `flexible` enough to choose the programming language which matters the most for a specific task. Berlin Framework will `automagically` inject the dependencies and provide you unmatched integration and interoperability across the code written in multiple programming languages all deployed in the same container. Sounds exciting? 

We certainly plan to take web application development to the `next level` and be `enterprise ready`!

##How to contribute?
Connect with us through GitHub. We will try to honour your interest and time in the best possible way. 

##Development
The project is divided into sub projects. You can use your preferred IDE for development.

When we introduce Polygot support later, we plan to release an IntelliJ IDEA plugin which will enable you to develop, build, test and deploy polygot web applications using Berlin Framework.

##Build
We are using Gradle to build the projects. 

##Tutorials
We suggest you to build and run the berlin-webmvc-test project.

More tutorials coming soon!
