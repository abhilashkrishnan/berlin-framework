# Berlin Framework
Polyglot web framework 

# Why another framework?
Berlin Framework aims to be `an innovative polyglot web framework` with support for `Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Groovy, Kotlin, Ceylon, Clojure`. What it means is that you will be able to write complete web applications in any or all of those programming languages using Berlin Framework. 

Berlin Framework will provide you `hassle-free` interoperability between code written in multiple programming languages. For example you will be able to write a web module in Python or Ruby and a database module in Java or Scala. You will be seamlessly able to call data access operations of the Java or Scala database module from the web module written in Python or Ruby.

Your development pipeline will be able to `mix-and-match` and be `flexible` enough to choose the programming language which matters the most for a specific task or `faster-time-to-market`. Berlin Framework will `automagically` inject the dependencies and provide you unmatched integration and interoperability across the code written in multiple programming languages. Sounds exciting?

## How to contribute?
Connect with us through GitHub. We will try to honour your interest and time in the best possible way. 

## Development
The project is divided into sub projects. You can use your preferred IDE for development.

When we introduce Polyglot support later, we are planning to release plugins for IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse which will enable you to develop, build, test and deploy polyglot web applications using Berlin Framework.

## Build
Currently we are using Gradle to build the JVM projects. 

## Tutorials
We suggest you to build and run the berlin-webmvc-test project.

More tutorials coming soon!
