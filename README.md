# Berlin Framework
Light-weight Dependency Injection and MVC Framework for the web. 

#Why another framework?
Berlin Framework aims to be a ploygot web framework with support for Java, Scala, JavaScript, PHP, Python and Ruby. What it means is that you will be able to write complete or "partial" web applications using any of those languages. Apart from this Berlin framework will provide interoperability between those languages. Say we have a web module written in Python or Ruby and a database module written in Java. You will be seamlessly able to call data access methods of Java module from the web module written in Python or Ruby. Your development pipleline will be able to choose which langauge matters the best for a specific task and Berlin Framework will provide you umatched integration and interoperability. Sounds exciting?
